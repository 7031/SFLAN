SausageFest LAN Party Script
============================
This is the script in use for the SausageFest LAN party site at http://sflan.joelnichols.co.uk. While I cannot guarantee that it'll be good quality code, useful for anything at all and won't cause everything in the world to explode, it may be useful to those who want to setup a LAN party site and don't mind investing a fair bit of techincal knowledge.
